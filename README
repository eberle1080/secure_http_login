I wrote this for a friend a few years ago. His hosting provider didn't allow https (or some such
bullcrap) and he wanted a login page. I destroyed the one he had, and wrote this to show how
to write one that (probably) isn't vulnerable.

You could technically just start using this, but I make no guarantees. If the dead rise and haunt
the studio apartment you live in because you decide to use this, don't you dare point those dead
bastards in my direction. You were warned, you'll live with the poultergeist of login page bugs
and like it.
